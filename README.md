# Introduction To Neural Networks Lecture HW

* Perceptron learning algorithm implementation in Python.
* The task is to create perceptron weights which classifies given letter (7x9 matrix).
* Letters are A, B, C, D, E, J, K and there are 3 font for each letter.
* All letters are mapped into a 7x9 matrix.
* But for training purposes these matrices are flattened as vectors length of 63.
* In characters_all folder you will see these flattened vectors.
* You can think mapped letters as:
